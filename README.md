# ExpressSaysHello

This repo was made to get a jist of using Express. Given that Express is a routing framework similar to Sinatra, I wanted to do a short experiment to get Express to say hello to you

# How to Use

1. Clone the project in the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/thatdania/ExpressSaysHello.git
```
2. Change into the project directory
```
cd ExpressSaysHello
```
3. Run the below code to start the program. Ps: Make sure you have Node.
```
node index.js
```
4. Write your hello and name in the query below. For example:
Write hello and then your name as such. Add on after the localhost. 
```
http://localhost:5000/hello/dania
```
